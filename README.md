# Open Facilities 🏫

## Introduction

Hey there! 👋 I'm working on Open Facilities, an open-source facilities reservation app designed specifically with school districts in mind. The project is currently in progress and targeting a 1.0 release. You can either self-host it for free or opt for a paid SaaS solution once it's out. You can see it in action on its first official live usage for Laurel Public Schools in Montana at [https://facilities.laurel.k12.mt.us](https://facilities.laurel.k12.mt.us)

## Status 🚧

The project is still under active development, and I'm super excited about the updates that are coming soon. Stay tuned for the official release!

### Roadmap 🗺️

- [x] UI Cleanup
- [x] Migrate database to Supabase
- [ ] Convert all customizable options into env variables
- [ ] Migrate all calendar events to Google Calendar
- [ ] Customizable Docker Compose
- [ ] Demo Site

## Contributing 🤝

I'm currently accepting contributions! If you're interested in contributing, here's what you need to know:

- **Framework**: The project is built with Next.js and its newer App Router.
- **Package Manager**: I'm using pnpm for package management.
- **Language**: The codebase is in TypeScript.
- **Database**: I'm using Prisma as the ORM for a MySQL database. However, I'm in the process of migrating to Supabase for the official launch.

## Documentation 📚

Full documentation will be available at the time of release. So, keep an eye out for that!
