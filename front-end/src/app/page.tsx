              Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm working on Open Facilities, an open-source
              facilities reservation app designed specifically with school
              districts in mind. The project is currently in progress and
              targeting a 1.0 release. You can either self-host it for free or
              opt for a paid SaaS solution once it's out. You can see it in
              action on its first official live usage for Laurel Public Schools
              in Montana at{' '}
